# About {-}

This is the documentation of the
[**ComplexHeatmap**](https://github.com/jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap) package. Examples in the book
are generated under version 2.7.6.1004.

You can get a stable Bioconductor version from http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html, but the most up-to-date version is always on Github and you can install it by:


```r
library(devtools)
install_github("jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap")
```

The [development branch on Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html) is
basically synchronized to Github repository. 

The **ComplexHeatmap** package is inspired from the [**pheatmap**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pheatmap) package. You can find many arguments in **ComplexHeatmap** have the same names as in **pheatmap**. Also you
can find [this old package](https://github.com/jokergoo/pheatmap2) that I tried to develop by modifying **pheatmap**.

**Please note, this documentation is not completely compatible with older versions (< 1.99.0, before
Oct, 2018), but the major functionality keeps the same.**

If you use **ComplexHeatmap** in your publications, I am appreciated if you can cite:
